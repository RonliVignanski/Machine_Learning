## About
These are five little projects I have done during thr course: Introduction to Machine Learning.

---

### Ex1 
Implementing K - means algorithm.

---

### Ex2
Implementing algorithms which are from the classification type. Specifically, implementing KNN, perceptron, pasive aggressive and SVM.
For each algorithm I implemented train and test methods. I chose hyper-parameters by using K-fold method.

### Ex3
Implementing a fully connected neural network with backpropagation, written in python from scratch, without using any related machine learning libraries.  
* The data set: MNIST
---

###  Ex4
Implementing a fully connected neural network with backpropagation, written in python using PyTorch.
* The data set: FASHION MNIST
---

### Ex5
Implementing CNN with backpropagation, written in python using PyTorch.
* The data set: GOOGLE COMMANDS
---

* NOTICE: all the data sets can be found on the internet.
